# stream_sim
Stellar stream simulation tools.

## generate
This module is used to generate (initially toy model) stellar streams. This means catalog level injection into either generated background or realistic one (e.g. DC2).
Eventually, we will want to be able to take simulation outputs as an input for the generation.
