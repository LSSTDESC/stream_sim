# About StreamSim

## Overview

**StreamSim** is a Python package designed for stellar stream data generation and observation simulation. It provides a complete pipeline to transform theoretical or dynamical stream models into realistic mock observations as they would appear in astronomical surveys.

```{note}
StreamSim is **not** intended for generating dynamical models or N-body simulations. Instead, it provides tools to study statistical realizations of parametrized stream geometries and convert simulation outputs into mock observations.
```

## What StreamSim Does

StreamSim enables to:

1. **Generate mock stellar stream data** from parametric models
   - Create positions of stars along streams using various parametric descriptions
   - Model stream morphologies including linear, sinusoidal, and spline-based geometries
   
2. **Assign photometric properties** to stream stars
   - Attribute magnitudes in multiple photometric bands based on stellar isochrones
   
3. **Simulate survey observations** of streams
   - Convert idealized mock data into observable quantities for specific surveys (e.g., LSST)
    - Apply survey selection functions and detection limits
    - Generate realistic photometric errors and observational uncertainties

## Use Cases

StreamSim is particularly useful for people who:

- Run **dynamical simulations** of stellar streams and need to convert results into observable quantities
- Develop **stream detection algorithms** and require realistic test data with known properties
- Need to generate **mock catalogs** for testing analysis pipelines
- ...
